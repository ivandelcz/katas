## Test Driven Development

### [Fizz Buzz](fizz_buzz/)

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three it returns “Fizz” instead of the number, and for multiples of five it returns “Buzz.” For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it returns “FizzBuzz.”

### [Leap Year](leap_year/)

Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.
A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.
